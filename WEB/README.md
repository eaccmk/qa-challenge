## NOTE

Things Kept in Mind while completing this assignment:

- Forked the project to my own bitbucket repository.
- Created my feature branch ```feature/MillanKaul-QloyalCodeTest```
- Once you are complete push code to the feature branch only.
Tried to use best practices and best of my knowledge to write the code as per my experience and day to day development work.

Things to share : This is the 1st time I used testcafe and really loved it specially how it helps to automate quickly would keep watch and myself update on this tool, thank you! for sharing testcafe.
